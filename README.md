## Motivation For My Projects:

### NBA Draft Class Superstar Prediction:
### My team's motivation for this project (as major league fans of the NBA) is to incorporate the power of statistics into the game we love. The game of basketball is very dynamic and the expectations of the league changes year after year. We as a team felt the need to capitalize on that fact and to develop predictive models to figure out which direction the NBA is moving towards and the likelihood of success of individual draft classes. Different metrics we measured were which positions thrived and which positions didn't. Another metric we wanted to investigate was the likelihood a player would most likely be classified as a superstar and we incorporated clusters to group certain variables together as a way to classify players for future draft classes to come.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection:
### My partner and I's motivation for the credit card fraud detection project was solely based on the fact that identity theft and credit card default is so prevalent in the United States. We as a team felt the need to investigate the inner workings of the banking and credit system. Leveraging big data, we were able to pinpoint exactly which demographics possessed the greatest probability of commiting credit card fraud. However, our findings taught us more than we bargained for. Often times, we as human tend to approach different problems with our own predetermined biases. It is this bias that made our discovery all the more interesting and unpredictable. Through the coding and analyzing stages of this project, we learned to leave our biases and approach different problems with an open mind and unfiltered to best encapsulate all our findings.

### Inc. 5000 Dashboard:
### The Inc. 5000 Dashboard was a class project for my Enterprise Data Management course. The motivation for this project was "anyone can analyze data", but throughout the course of the semester, the emphasis was what were we going to do to leverage our analysis from a business standpoint. With the Inc. 5000 Dashboard, we focused more on the business decision aspect of data analytics. Using the dashboard, we could check different KPIs such as annual revenue growth rates or even employee turnover rates from thousands of companies in thousands of industries.
