## Motivation For My Projects:

### NBA Draft Class Superstar Prediction:
### My team's motivation for this project (as major league fans of the NBA) is to incorporate the power of statistics into the game we love. The game of basketball is very dynamic and the expectations of the league changes year after year. We as a team felt the need to capitalize on that fact and to develop predictive models to figure out which direction the NBA is moving towards and the likelihood of success of individual draft classes. Different metrics we measured were which positions thrived and which positions didn't. Another metric we wanted to investigate was the likelihood a player would most likely be classified as a superstar and we incorporated clusters to group certain variables together as a way to classify players for future draft classes to come.
